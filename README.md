## Viewabo

Viewabo allows support agents to send a link to access customersâ€™ phone cameras to see what they're seeing without having customers install an app. By enabling businesses to see things the way their customers see them, Viewabo empowers customer service teams by delivering a more streamlined diagnosis and issue resolution process. This reduces friction, faster turnaround times, and a better remote customer support experience.
