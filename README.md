# Visual Product Support

## Viewabo

Viewabo allows product support teams to send a link to access customersâ€™ phone cameras to see what they're seeing without having customers install an app. By enabling businesses to see things the way their customers see them, Viewabo empowers product support teams by delivering a more streamlined diagnosis and issue resolution process. This reduces friction, faster turnaround times, and a better remote product support experience.
